# CMRIT SMART COMMUTE

# Problem Statement
To design a car-pooling(sharing) system specifically for students of CMRIT which takes into
account the points of start of the commuter at that particular point in time to match with the
available vehicles during morning hours and similarly the points of stop of the commuter at
that particular point in time to match with available vehicles during the evening hours.

# Description

• The vehicle owner should be able to mention the availability of his/her vehicle for car pooling with the option before 24 hours.<br>
• The vehicle owners should be able to see all upcoming car pooling requests and approve/reject each request.<br>
• He / She should also be able to see a record of past trips.<br>
• There should also be options for forming temporary groups.<br>
• App should calculate and display the cost of the rides made by the commuters.<br>
• Owners should be able to see status of the payment of the raids(paid rides, pending payments).<br>

<b>Commuter</b><br>

3 parameters:<br>
